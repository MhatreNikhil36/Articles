# 🧠 Articles by Nikhil Mhatre

Welcome to **Articles**, a curated collection of hands-on, code-driven write-ups on topics I’m learning, exploring, or building in the world of **Data Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Science**.

This repository serves as the **main entry point** for anyone looking to read, learn, or experiment with the concepts I’ve documented — all backed by clean code and simple explanations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

* Share **conceptual deep-dives** in a practical way
* Document my **learning journey** in public
* Provide **clean, runnable code** alongside each article
* Create a reference space for **interview prep**, **experimentation**, and **portfolio showcase**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic or article lives in its **own subdirectory**, containing:

* A blog-style `README.md` explaining the concept
* Python code (`main.py`, notebooks, etc.) that demonstrates the idea
* A `test.py` file with unit tests wherever applicable
* Future expansion: diagrams, Jupyter notebooks, or visual demos

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

### 🧭 To Read

Navigate into any subfolder and read the `readme.md` — each one is written like a standalone article or blog post.

### ⚙️ To Run Code

All code is designed to be minimal and runnable:

```bash
cd TextVectorization
python main.py       # runs vectorization + similarity logic
python test.py       # runs unit tests
```

## 🧱 Philosophy

This repo isn’t just a code dump — it’s a **thinking space**, built to help:

* Me reinforce concepts through writing and coding
* Others get started with clean, real-world examples
