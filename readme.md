# 🧠 Articles by Nikhil Mhatre

Welcome to **Articles**, a collection of hands-on, code-focused write-ups on practical topics in **Data Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Science**.

This repo is my public learning space—a place for sharing, referencing, and experimenting with new concepts, with clean code and simple explanations for each article.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Share **practical deep-dives** with working code
* Document my **learning journey** in public
* Create a reference for **interview prep**, **portfolio**, and **experiments**

---

## 📂 Structure

Each article is a **self-contained folder** with:

* `readme.md`: Blog-style explanation (diagrams, code, best practices)
* Source code (`main.py`, notebooks, etc.)
* Optional: `test.py` for unit tests, or visual demos

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

**To Read:**
Open any subfolder and read the `readme.md` for an article-style explanation.

**To Run Code:**
Code is clean, minimal, and executable. Example:

```bash
cd Parquet
python main.py
```

Add your own data or tweak code as needed!

## 🧱 Repo Philosophy

This isn’t just a code dump.
I write to reinforce my own learning and to help others get started with real, working examples.
